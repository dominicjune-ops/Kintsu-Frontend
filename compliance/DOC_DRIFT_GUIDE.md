# Documentation Drift Checker

This script (`scripts/doc_drift_checker.py`) checks for compliance and documentation files that have not been updated in the last 90 days.

## Usage

```
python scripts/doc_drift_checker.py
```

- Run this as a scheduled job (e.g., weekly CI job) to ensure documentation is current.
- Flagged files should be reviewed and updated as needed.

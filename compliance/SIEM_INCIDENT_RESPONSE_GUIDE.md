# SIEM & Incident Response Integration

## SIEM Integration
- [ ] Forward audit logs and integrity hashes to SIEM (e.g., Azure Sentinel, Splunk, ELK)
- [ ] Configure alerts for suspicious or non-compliant actions (e.g., unauthorized deletions, privilege escalations)
- [ ] Monitor for failed policy checks in CI/CD

## Incident Response
- [ ] Maintain an incident response plan and playbook
- [ ] Ensure all audit logs are centralized and monitored
- [ ] Test incident response procedures quarterly
